A School Project that I wrote in C#. It's multiplayer card game.
In this card game you get to choose how many people are playing and how many cards each player gets, then each player is dealt their cards with a letter on it.
You will have a choice to pick up a card from the discard pile or a radnom card from the deck. Once you have cards you are prompted to make a word for points with your cards.
You can skip if you can't make a word and to end your turn you will have to choose a card to discard. The goal of the game is to get more points than your opponent. 
Each card/letter is worth a certain amount of points. When a player runs out of cards the game is finished or/and the game will prompt the user after each round
if they would like to end the game.
